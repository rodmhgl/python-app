# ADR-001: Container Base Image Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to choose a base image for our Python containerized application. Key considerations:

- Security (minimal attack surface)
- Size (faster deployment and reduced storage)
- Compatibility (Python 3.11 support)
- Maintenance overhead

## Options Considered

1. **python:3.11** - Full Debian-based image (~900MB)
2. **python:3.11-slim** - Minimal Debian (~150MB)
3. **python:3.11-alpine** - Alpine Linux based (~50MB)

##

We chose `python:3.11-alpine` as our base image.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Significantly smaller image size (50MB vs 900MB)
- Reduced attack surface due to minimal packages
- Faster container startup and deployment
- Lower bandwidth and storage costs

### Negative

- Some Python packages may require compilation
- Different package manager (apk vs apt)
- Potential compatibility issues with certain libraries
- Less debugging tools available in production

### Mitigation

- Use multi-stage builds if compilation is needed
- Maintain separate debug image with additional tools
- Thoroughly test all dependencies in Alpine environment
